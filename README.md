# Android game with augmented reality
- Gantt Chart and dissertation can be found in the Documents folder.
- Project Assets can be found within RPG GO V2/Assets folder.
- Project scripts can be found within RPG GO V2/Assets/Scripts folder.

<b>Important: On rare occasions after the app is installed, the map does not load immdetiately, in those cases a restart of an app seems to fix it.<b>
## How To Run the Android Game
The Game.apk file provided has a reduced spawning range and increased regeneration to make marking easier. However, points of interest will still need to be tested either by directly going to them or through Unity Engine Live mode. Additionally, the Augmented Reality game requires unmetered internet connection, GPS and a phone running at least Android 7.0 which has AR capabilities. The list of supported devices can be found here: https://developers.google.com/ar/devices

- Upload the Game.apk file from RPG GO V2 folder to your android phone.
- Locate the uploaded Game.apk file on your device and install it.
Your phone may ask to enable third party installs to install the app.
- Once the app is installed it should be either on your home screen or can be found using phones search typing in "RPG GO V2".
## Running the game in the Unity Engine
This might be tricky for people who have never used Unity and even after I provided these steps how to load up a Unity Project there might still be issues. Thus, I would recommend to reach out to me if you need help sorting out Unity to make my project running on your side.
- Install Unity Hub.
- Press Open and select add project from disk.
- Navigate to where your RPG GO V2 is located and select it.
- Once, everything is imported, select the project.
- press File -> Open Scene and navigate to Assets/Scenes and select world.unity file to open.
- pressing the play button on the world scene should run the game within Unity engine.

## Project Asset Refrences
For Reference I have not necessary use all of the assets within these listed asset packs, due to the sheer size of them. Additionally, some of the code is used from examples such as mapbox implementation is heavily based around their examples.
